# isola_python

Isola is a game played on a 7x7 grid. Each player starts on the center square of opposing edges of the grid. On a player's turn, that player moves one space orthogonally or diagonally and then destroys a square of the board, making it impassible terrain forever. The destroyed square can be any currently un-destroyed square that does not contain either player. If a player cannot make a move, that player loses and the other player wins.

Students create a child class of isola_player (in isola_game.py) which can play the game autonomously, and the bots play against one another.
